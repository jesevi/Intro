# Intro

Hey!, I'm Jason 

I've been a self taught web developer for the past year now. Over the past couple of years I've been curious about web development and finally found the courage to make the leap. I now have a huge passion for coding and learning all that has to do with web development. I am proficient in HTML, CSS and currently learning JavaScript.
